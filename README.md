Social networks are essential in modern communication, but they also present security challenges due to the vast amount of data shared daily. Detecting anomalies, such as spammers or suspicious users, is crucial for protecting network integrity. Our paper introduces a novel technique for global anomaly detection using network community structures, unlike traditional methods that focus on individual nodes and their immediate neighbors. Our approach targets nodes belonging to multiple communities or those whose neighbors belong to the same or no community. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate a 7-10% improvement in F-Score and a 29% increase in Jaccard similarity, along with a 1.83Ã— speedup over existing algorithms.
